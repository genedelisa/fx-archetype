# Basic JavaFX 2 app

A Maven archetype for a JavaFX 2 application.

It uses the zenjava maven plugin for JavaFX. Zenjava has archetypes, but they did not
fit my needs.


This project is explained in my [Blog post](http://rockhoppertech.com/blog/fxarchetype).

## Usage

mvn install

in order to add to your local catalog

Then select the archetype when you create a new maven project.
