# Basic JavaFX 2 app

A Maven archetype for a JavaFX 2 application.

It uses the [ZenJava JavaFX Maven plugin](http://zenjava.com/javafx/maven/)
. Zenjava has archetypes too, but they did not
fit my needs.



This project is explained in my [Blog post](http://rockhoppertech.com/blog/fxarchetype).

## Usage

    mvn install

in order to add to your local catalog. You might want to update the catalog too.

    mvn archetype:update-local-catalog

Then select the archetype when you create a new maven project.
